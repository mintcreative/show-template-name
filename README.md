#Show Template Name
=============================

## A WordPress plugin from the Interactive Team at Mint Creative

### Reveals the page template filename

How many times have you been working away in _WordPress_ only to stop and ask yourself, "Hang on, which page template is this using..?".
Well, this plugin answers that question for you. Show Template Name queries the page template, gets the filename and writes it into the HTML as a comment tag in the <head>. You can then 'view source' to see the filename. Ta-daaa.

You can also add an optional message in a comment tag that appears immediately above the Show Template Name comment. This can be useful for debugging purposes or simply helping you to find the comment tags quickly.

Constructive comments and suggestions for improvements are welcome.

We hope you find this useful.
